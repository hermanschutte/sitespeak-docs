## Enabled Languages

Add multiple languages to support visitors from different regions. Your chatbot will display all labels and messages in the visitor's preferred language.

### Language Detection

Choose how your chatbot determines which language to display:

- **Auto-detect language**: Automatically detects the visitor's language from their browser or page settings
- **Specific language**: Force the chatbot to always display in a particular language

### Adding a New Language

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Add Language">
    In the **Enabled Languages** section, click the **+ Add Language** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter language details">
    Specify the language code (e.g., `fr` for French, `de` for German) and language name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Add">
    Click the **Add** button to add the new language.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Setting a Default Language

One language is marked as **Default**. This is used when:
- The visitor's language cannot be detected
- The visitor's language hasn't been configured in your chatbot

## Email Notification Localization

Escalation notification emails sent to your team can also be localized. These emails are sent in your chatbot's **default language** when a visitor requests human assistance.

### Available Placeholders

Use the following placeholders in your email notification text. They will be replaced with actual values when the email is sent:

| Placeholder | Description |
|---|---|
| `{{inbox_link}}` | Full URL to the visitor's inbox |
| `{{visitor_name}}` | Visitor's full name (or "Unknown visitor" if not provided) |
| `{{visitor_email}}` | Visitor's email address |
| `{{visitor_phone}}` | Visitor's phone number |
| `{{last_question}}` | The visitor's last message |
| `{{chatbot_name}}` | Name of the chatbot |
| `{{app_name}}` | Application name (SiteSpeakAI) |

### Customizable Email Fields

You can customize the following parts of the escalation email:

- **Email Subject** - e.g., `{{chatbot_name}}: Visitor needs human assistance`
- **Greeting** - e.g., `Hello!`
- **Introduction Message** - Supports markdown links, e.g., `Visit your [inbox]({{inbox_link}})`
- **Last Question Label** - Label shown above the visitor's last message
- **Contact Information Labels** - Labels for name, email, phone, and internal user ID
- **Button Text** - The call-to-action button text
- **Footer, Sign Off, and Sender Name** - Closing content of the email

<Tip>
  The introduction message field supports markdown, so you can include links like `[inbox]({{inbox_link}})` that will render as clickable links in the email.
</Tip>

## How It Works

Once you've configured multiple languages:

1. **Visitor arrives**: When a visitor opens your chatbot, their browser language is detected
2. **Language matched**: If you've configured that language, all interface text displays in their language
3. **AI responds**: The AI also responds in the detected language, using your training content
4. **Fallback**: If the language isn't configured, the default language is used

---

## AI Language Support

Beyond interface localization, your chatbot's AI can understand and respond in virtually any language:

- The AI automatically detects the language of incoming messages
- Responses are generated in the same language the visitor uses
- For best results in specific languages, add training content in those languages

### Supported Languages

The AI supports all major languages including:
- English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch
- Chinese, Japanese, Korean
- Arabic, Hebrew, Hindi
- And many more...

<Note>
  Interface localization (labels and buttons) requires you to configure each language. AI responses work in any language automatically.
</Note>

## Best Practices

- **Start with your primary language**: Configure your default language completely before adding others
- **Be consistent**: Use the same tone and terminology across all languages
- **Test thoroughly**: Preview your chatbot in each configured language
- **Consider regional variations**: Create separate entries for variants like `en-US` and `en-GB` if needed
