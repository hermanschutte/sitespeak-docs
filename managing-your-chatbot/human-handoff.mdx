Sometimes your visitors need to speak with a human. SiteSpeakAI makes it easy to escalate conversations to your support team when the AI can't fully help.

## How human handoff works

When enabled, visitors can request to speak with a human agent. They'll be prompted to enter their email address, and your team receives a notification with the conversation details.

## Enable escalations

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Configuration">
    In your chatbot dashboard, click **Configuration** in the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Settings">
    Click on **Settings**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Escalations tab">
    Click on the **Escalations** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Escalations">
    Toggle on **Enable Escalations** to allow visitors to escalate to human support.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Email notifications

Get notified via email when a visitor escalates:

1. Toggle on **Enable Email Notifications**
2. Enter your email address(es) in the **Escalation Notification Email(s)** field
3. Separate multiple emails with semicolons (`;`)

### Round robin notifications

If you have multiple team members handling support, enable **Round Robin Notifications** to rotate escalations between email addresses instead of sending to all. Each escalation goes to the next email in the list.

<Tip>
  Round robin is great for distributing workload evenly across your support team without overwhelming everyone with notifications.
</Tip>

## Slack notifications

Receive escalation notifications directly in your Slack workspace:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Slack">
    Go to **Install Agent → Slack** and click **Connect to Slack**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the app">
    Authorize SiteSpeakAI to access your Slack workspace.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Invite to a channel">
    Invite the SiteSpeakAI bot to the channel where you want to receive notifications.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Slack notifications">
    Back in **Settings → Escalations**, toggle on **Enable Slack Notifications**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  You must connect Slack in Deploy & Install before the Slack notification option becomes available.
</Note>

## How visitors escalate

Once enabled, visitors can escalate to human support by:

- **Asking to speak with a human**: The AI recognizes requests like "Can I talk to a person?" or "I need human help"
- **The AI offering escalation**: When the AI can't confidently answer, it can offer to connect the visitor with a human

When a visitor escalates, they'll be prompted to enter their email address so your team can follow up.

## Responding via Live Chat

When you receive an escalation notification, you can respond to visitors in real-time through the Inbox.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Inbox">
    Click **Inbox** in the sidebar to see all conversations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the conversation">
    Find the escalated conversation and click on it to open.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Live Chat">
    Type your message in the input field and send. This automatically starts a Live Chat session.
  </Step>
  <Step title="End Live Chat">
    When finished, click the **End Live Chat** button in the conversation header. This returns control to the AI assistant.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  While Live Chat is active, the AI assistant will not respond to messages. This ensures the visitor only communicates with your support team until you end the session.
</Tip>

## Customizing escalation messages

You can customize the messages shown to visitors during escalation in the **Localization** tab under Settings, including:

- The message shown when escalating
- Email input placeholder text
- Confirmation messages

## Best practices

- **Set expectations**: Let visitors know typical response times in your escalation confirmation message
- **Use round robin**: Distribute escalations evenly across your team
- **Connect Slack**: Get real-time notifications where your team already communicates
- **Review escalations**: Regularly review why visitors escalate to improve your AI's training
