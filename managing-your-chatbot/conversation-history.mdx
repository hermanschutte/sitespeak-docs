<Note>
  In the SiteSpeak dashboard, this section is labeled **Inbox**.
</Note>

The Conversation History page lets you view all conversations between visitors and your chatbot. You can search, filter, translate messages, and jump into live chat when needed.

## Viewing conversations

The left sidebar lists all visitors sorted by most recent activity. Click on a visitor to see their full conversation history.

Use the controls at the top to narrow down conversations:

- **Open / Closed**: Filter by conversation status
- **Category**: Filter by conversation category
- **Search**: Search for specific conversations by keyword

## Contact details

The right panel displays visitor information including their name, email address, when they were last seen, and their total message count.

## Translating messages

<Note>
  Message translation is available on the **[Business](/pricing)** plan.
</Note>

Hover over any message in a conversation and click **Translate** to automatically translate it into your browser's language. Click **Show Original** to revert back. Translated messages display a "Translated" indicator so you can tell them apart from the original text.

## Replying via Live Chat

You can respond to visitors directly from the Conversation History page by typing a message in the input field. This starts a Live Chat session where the AI is paused until you end it.

For full details on escalations and live chat, see [Human handoff](/managing-your-chatbot/human-handoff).
