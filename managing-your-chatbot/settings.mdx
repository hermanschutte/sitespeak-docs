## Basic Settings

The Basic tab contains core configuration options for your chatbot.

### Agent ID

Your unique chatbot identifier. You'll need this ID to connect to your agent using Zapier and other integrations.

### Default Answer

The fallback response when your agent cannot find a relevant answer in its training data. You can customize this message or reset it to the default.

### Default Language

Select the language your agent uses when replying. Set to **Auto** to automatically detect and respond in the visitor's language.

### Insights Email Frequency

Choose how often you receive email summaries with your chatbot's top answered and unanswered questions. Options include:
- Daily
- Weekly
- Monthly
- Never

### Enable Media In Messages

When enabled, your agent can display images and videos directly in messages. When disabled, the agent will provide a link to the media instead.

### Enable Feedback

Allow visitors to provide feedback on responses by selecting thumbs up or thumbs down after each message. This helps you identify which responses need improvement.

### Page Context Awareness

Allow the agent to understand the current page content when responding to questions. The agent will analyze the page where the chat is embedded to provide more relevant answers.

### Enable File Uploads

Allow visitors to upload files to the agent with their messages. Your agent can process these files and use them to answer questions.

## AI Model Settings

Configure the AI model powering your chatbot and customize its behavior.

</Frame>

### Model

Select which AI model your agent uses to generate answers and perform actions. Available models include various OpenAI GPT versions and other providers.

<Note>
  Be careful when changing these settings as it may affect the performance of your agent. Test your agent after making changes.
</Note>

### Instructions

Customize the behavior, tone, and personality of your agent. The default instructions define:
- The agent's role and demeanor
- How it should handle questions outside its training data
- Whether it can use general knowledge or only trained content
- How to handle attempts to change the conversation topic

You can add custom instructions to:
- Define a specific persona or brand voice
- Include additional context about your business
- Set rules for handling specific types of questions

### Model Temperature

Control the randomness of responses on a scale from 0 to 1:
- **0**: Most predictable and consistent responses
- **1**: More creative and varied responses

For support chatbots, lower values (0-0.3) are typically recommended for accuracy.

## Notice Settings

Display a notice message that users must accept before starting a chat. This is useful for terms and conditions, privacy notices, or other important information.

### Voice Recognition & Text-to-Speech

Enable voice input and audio responses for your chatbot. For detailed configuration, see [Voice & TTS](/managing-your-chatbot/voice-and-tts).

### Restriction Level

Control how strictly your agent adheres to its training data:

| Level | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **Max** (Default) | Agent will only answer based on the training data |
| **Low** | Agent will attempt to use training data, but can also use some general ChatGPT knowledge |
| **None** | No restrictions, agent will answer any query |

### Rate Limiting

Prevent abuse by limiting the number of messages a visitor can send within a 5-minute window.

- **Enable Rate Limiting**: Toggle to activate message limits
- **Maximum Messages (per 5 minutes)**: Set the message cap (default: 20)
- **Rate Limit Message**: Customize the message shown when visitors exceed the limit

### Domain Restrictions

Control where your chatbot can be loaded:

- **Allowed Domains**: Add specific domains where your chatbot is permitted to load. Leave empty to allow all domains.
- **Custom Domain**: Serve your agent from your own custom domain (available on Business and Enterprise plans).

### Page URL Filtering

Control which pages your chatbot appears on by filtering based on URL paths.

- **Filter Mode**: Choose between three modes:
  - **Disabled**: The chatbot loads on all pages (default)
  - **Include only**: The chatbot loads only on pages matching the specified patterns (whitelist)
  - **Exclude**: The chatbot loads on all pages except those matching the specified patterns (blacklist)
- **URL Patterns**: Add URL path patterns to match against. Use `*` as a wildcard to match any characters in a path segment.
  - `/pricing` — matches only the pricing page
  - `/blog/*` — matches all pages under `/blog/`
  - `/docs/*` — matches all pages under `/docs/`

<Note>
  Page URL filtering is applied client-side. It is bypassed in preview mode so you can always test your chatbot.
</Note>

### IP Address Blocking

Block specific IP addresses or ranges from interacting with your chatbot.

- **Enable IP Blocking**: Toggle to activate IP-based blocking
- **Blocked IPs**: Add individual IP addresses or CIDR ranges to block.
  - `192.168.1.1` — blocks a single IP address
  - `10.0.0.0/8` — blocks an entire IP range

<Note>
  IP address blocking is applied server-side. It is bypassed in preview mode so you can always test your chatbot.
