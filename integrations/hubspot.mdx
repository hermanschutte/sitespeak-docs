SiteSpeakAI integrates with HubSpot to automatically create and update contacts in HubSpot when leads are captured by your chatbot. This keeps all your contacts in sync and up to date.

## Connect HubSpot

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Integrations">
    In your chatbot dashboard, go to **Configuration > Settings** and click the **Integrations** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find HubSpot">
    Locate the **HubSpot** integration card.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Connect">
    Click the **Connect** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize">
    A popup will appear asking you to connect your SiteSpeakAI account to HubSpot. You can either:
    - **Create a new HubSpot account** if you don't have one
    - **Sign in to your HubSpot account** if you already have one
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Connected State

Once connected, you'll see:
- A green **Connected** badge
- Your HubSpot **Account** email
- Your HubSpot **Portal ID**

All newly captured leads will now automatically be added to your HubSpot contacts with a note containing the context of their conversation.

## Enable Automatic Support Tickets

You can optionally enable automatic ticket creation:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find Create Tickets">
    In the connected HubSpot card, locate the **Create Tickets** section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Toggle On">
    Enable the toggle to automatically create a support ticket in HubSpot when a lead is captured.
  </Step>
</Steps>

When enabled, each captured lead will also create a support ticket containing the chat history as context, so your support team can easily follow up.
