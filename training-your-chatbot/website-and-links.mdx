## Best Practices

- **Start with key pages**: Train on your most important content first (FAQs, product pages, documentation)
- **Review content quality**: Ensure pages have meaningful text content, not just images or videos
- **Remove duplicates**: Avoid training on multiple pages with the same content
- **Update regularly**: Retrain sources when your website content changes significantly
