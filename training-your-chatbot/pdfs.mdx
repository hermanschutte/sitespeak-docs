## Best Practices

### Ensure Text is Extractable

- PDFs should contain actual text, not just scanned images
- Check that you can copy and paste text from your PDF before uploading
- Scanned documents may not extract properly if they haven't been OCR processed

### Use Descriptive File Names

- Name your files clearly so you can identify them in your Sources list
- This makes it easier to manage and update content later

### Keep Content Current

- Re-upload files when the content changes
- Delete outdated versions from your Sources to avoid confusion
