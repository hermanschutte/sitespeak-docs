Fine-tuning helps you improve your chatbot's responses over time. When your chatbot gives an incorrect or incomplete answer, you can provide corrections that it will learn from.

## Why Fine-Tune?

Even with good training data, your chatbot may:
- Miss nuances in certain questions
- Provide outdated information
- Use the wrong tone or format
- Lack context for specific scenarios

Fine-tuning addresses these issues by letting you teach the chatbot exactly how to respond.

## Best Practices

### Review Conversation Logs

Regularly check your chatbot's conversations in the **Inbox** to identify:
- Frequently asked questions with poor answers
- Topics where the chatbot seems confused
- Missed opportunities to provide helpful information

### Be Specific

When adding updated answers:
- Match the exact phrasing visitors use
- Include common variations of the question
- Provide complete, helpful responses

### Test Your Changes

After fine-tuning:
- Use **Test Agent** to verify the improvement
- Monitor real conversations to confirm it's working
- Iterate if needed

## Adjusting AI Instructions

For broader changes, update your AI instructions in [Settings](/managing-your-chatbot/settings):

- **Tone**: Make responses more formal or casual
- **Length**: Set preferred response length
- **Behavior**: Define how to handle certain topics
- **Restrictions**: Limit what the chatbot will discuss
