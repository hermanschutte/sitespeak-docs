- Provide answers based on relevant wiki pages
- Cite sources so visitors know where the information comes from
- Handle follow-up questions with context awareness

### Example Interaction

**Visitor**: "How do I reset my password?"

**Chatbot**: "To reset your password, go to the login page and click 'Forgot Password'. Enter your email address and you'll receive a reset link within a few minutes. If you don't see the email, check your spam folder."
